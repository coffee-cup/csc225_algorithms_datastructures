A **proper binary tree** is a tree in which each node has 0 or two children.
A proper binary tree can be defined with an **inductive definition**:
 - A proper binary tree of height 0 is a single node
 - a proper binary tree of height 1 or greater is a node with two children, each of which is the root of a proper binary tree.
