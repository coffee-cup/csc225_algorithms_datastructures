# Binary Search Trees

### Definition

A *binary search tree* is a binary tree in which an in-order traversal produces a sorted sequence.

Alternatively, a binary search tree can be defined as a binary tree in which, for every node *v*, no nodes in the left subtree of *v* are greater than *v* and no nodes in the right subtree of *v* are less than *v*.
