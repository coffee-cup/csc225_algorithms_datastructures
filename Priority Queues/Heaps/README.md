# Heaps

A **heap** is a specialized binary tree data structure with two extra properties:

 - **Heap Property**: The value at a node must be less than or equal to the values of its children
 -
 - **Shape Property**: A heap must be a complete binary tree

### Heap Insertion

First, a new node for element 6 is allocated in the next available position on the last level. (This maintains the *shape property*)

After the element is added, the heap property is restored.

### Heap Removal

To remove the minimum, the element at the root is deleted from the tree.

To fill the 'hole' left by the deleted element, the last element in the last row is moved into the empty position

The heap property is restored by 'bubbling down' the new root

### The Height of a Heap

**Theorem**: In a heap with with height *h*, there are exactly *2^i* nodes at levels *0, 1, 2, ..., h-1* and at most *2^h* nodes at level *h*.

**Proof Outline**:
A heap of height 0 is a single node, and the theorem holds. The theorem can be proven by induction using h = 0 as a basis. The induction step should use a combination of the hypothesis and the shape property.

**Corollary**: In a heap with *n* nodes and height *h*, *h <= log_2(n)*

### Array Based Heaps
Heaps can be represented be an array with a convenient numbering scheme

 - Nodes are numbered level by level, from left to right, starting at the root.
 - This indexing scheme allows convenient traversal of the tree
    - Parent(i) = i/2 (integer division)
    - LeftChild(i) = 2i
    - RightChild(i) = 2i + 1


 ### Heapify

 To create a heap containing the values in the array, create an empty heap and add elements one-by-one.

 This requires */theta(n* log *n*) operations, because the last *n/2* insertions will be into a tree of height at least log_2(n-1).

 It is also possible to build a heap with bottom-up approach, using an algorithm called **Heapify**.

 A complete binary tree containing the input sequence is created and gradually converted into a heap from the bottom to the top.

 First, all single nodes are converted into heaps

 Next, convert the subtrees of height 1 to heaps.

 The bottom-up construction merges subtrees into larger heaps repeatedly, working upwards from the bottom of the tree.

 Eventually, the entire tree is a heap.

 > **Claim**: *Heapify* constructs a heap of *n* elements with */theta(n)* operations.
 > **Proof**: A cursory analysis seems to suggest that the *n* bubble-down operations require */theta(nlog(n))* operations. To prove that only */theta(n)* operations are necessary, we will consider the operations at each level of the tree separately.
