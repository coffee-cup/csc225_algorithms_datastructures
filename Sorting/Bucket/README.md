# Bucket Sort

Simple algorithm for sorting sequences with a small number of possible values.

- A bucket is created for each type of element.
- The first part of bucket sort loops over the input array, adding each element to its respective bucket.

To generate sorted array, the buckets are visited in ascending order and each bucket's contents are appened to the array.

Bucket sort is very efficient when sorting on a key with a limited number of values. If there are b bucketsm the running time of bucket sort on an array of size n is O(n+b)
