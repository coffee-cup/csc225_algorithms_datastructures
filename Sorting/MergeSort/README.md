# Merge Sort

**Best**: O(nlogn) **Expected**: O(nlogn) **Worse**: O(nlogn)

Divide and conquer algorithm

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted)
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists utnil there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
