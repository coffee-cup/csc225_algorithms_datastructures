# Heap Sort

**Best**: O(nlogn) **Expected**: O(nlogn) **Worse**: O(nlogn)

Heap Sort can be implemented as an in-place algorithm using array-based heaps, by converting the input array to a max-heap using Heapify.

Bolded values correspond to elements of valid heaps

After the input array has been converted to a max-heap, the RemoveMax operation is used to repeatedly remove the maximum element

As each element is removed, it is places at the end of the array, in the position freed up by the remove operation

After the last heap removal, the array is sorted
