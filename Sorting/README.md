Any comparison-based sorting algorithm requires Omega(nlogn) operations in the worst case

## Selection Approach

_left_

Sort the array by moving one element at a time into its sorted position

## Divide and Conquer Approach

_right_

Sort the array by dividing it into parts, sorting the parts, then combining the sorted parts together

## Stable Sorting

A sorting algorithm is **stable** if it guarantees that the order of equal elements is preserved

## In-place algorithms

- Some sorting algorithms do all of their work 'inside' the input array.
- Selection sort (left) does not allocate any extra arrays
- Merge sort (right) allocates new arrays fo facilitate recursive sorting and merging

## Best and Worst case inputs

| Algorithm | Best        | Worst                             |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Insertion | [1,2,3,4,5] | [5,4,3,2,1]                       |
| Selection | dont matter | dm                                |
| Merge     | dm          | dm                                |
| Quick     | [1,1,1,1,1] | [1,2,3,4,5] if pivot is element 0 |
| Bubble    | [1,2,3,4,5] | [5,4,3,2,1]                       |
| Heap      | dm          | dm                                |
| Radix     | dm          | dm                                |
