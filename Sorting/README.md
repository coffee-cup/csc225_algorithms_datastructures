Any comparison-based sorting algorithm requires Omega(nlogn) operations in the worst case

## Selection Approach

Sort the array by moving one element at a time into its sorted position

## Divide and Conquer Approach

Sort the array by dividing it into parts, sorting the parts, then combining the sorted parts together

## Stable Sorting

A sorting algorithm is **stable** if it guarantees that the order of equal elements is preserved

## In-place algorithms

- Some sorting algorithms do all of their work 'inside' the input array.
- Selection sort (left) does not allocate any extra arrays
- Merge sort (right) allocates new arrays fo facilitate recursive sorting and merging
