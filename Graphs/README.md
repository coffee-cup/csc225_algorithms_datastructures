# Graphs

- a **graph** is a collection of **vertices** and **edges**
- Two vertices which are joined by an edge are said to be **neighbours** or **adjacent**
- The **degree** of a vertex, denoted by deg(v), is the number of edges incident to v
- For two vertices u and w, a **path** between u and w is a sequence of vertices which connects u to w

- a **cycle** is a path of length at least 1 whcih begins and ends at the same vertex

- a graph G is **connected** if, for every pair of vertices u and w, there exists at least one uw-path

- in an **undirected** graph, edges join pairs of vertices but have no directionality

- a **directed** graph is a graph in which edges have a direction

- a **complete** is a graph G of n vertices with an edge between every pair of vertices

- a **tree** is a connected, acyclic graph

## Bipartite

A graph is **bipartite** if the vertices of G can be partitioned into sets X and Y such that no edge connects two vertices in X or two vertices in Y

## Running Time of Traversals

In both DFS and BFS, each vertex is visited and processed at most once.
When a vertex v is visited, the traversal algorithms iterate over all neghbours of v and traverse any unvisited neighbours. The total running time is then ![](http://i.imgur.com/kxXoyIm.png)
Therefore, the running time of DFS and BFS is ![](http://i.imgur.com/I439pFK.png)

## Transitive Closure

The **transitive closure** of a graph G is a graph C containing the vertices of G and an edge uv if v is reachable from u in G.

- Transitive closures of undirected graphs convert each component into a complete graph
- Computed in O(n^2) time by traversing each component and adding all possible edges between the vertices in the component
