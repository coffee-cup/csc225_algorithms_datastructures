### Running Time of Traversals

In both DFS and BFS, each vertex is visited and processed at most once.
When a vertex v is visited, the traversal algorithms iterate over all neghbours of v and traverse any unvisited neighbours. The total running time is then ![](http://i.imgur.com/kxXoyIm.png)
Therefore, the running time of DFS and BFS is ![](http://i.imgur.com/I439pFK.png)
