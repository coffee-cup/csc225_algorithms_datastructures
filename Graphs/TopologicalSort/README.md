# Topological Sorting

A **directed acyclic graph** (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles

a **minimum** is a vertext with no incoming edges

a **maximum** is a vertex with no outgoing edges

A **topologically sorted ordering** of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph G is a listing of vertices such that if (u, v) in E(G), then u appears before v in the listing.

*e.g. In the graph above, the ordering c, a, b, e, d is topologically sorted*

A graph may have multiple topologically sorted orderings


## Finding Topologically Sorted Ordering

Start by adding all minimum vertices to the queue

At each step, remove a vertex from the front of the queue and add it to the topologically sorted ordering

As each vertex is processed, delete it and all incident edges from the graph

When a vertex is deleted, inspect all of its neighbours and add any new minimum vertices to the queue

Vertices d and h are added to the queue

When i is deleted, vertex b becomes a minimum

The algorithm is essentially BFS with one extra condition governing when a vertex can be visited

## Topological Sorting with DFS

A post-ordering of vertices in a DFS traversal is topologically sorted.
Constructs the ordering in reverse

In the diagram above, the vertex being visited is green and other vertices in the same branch of the DFS tree are blue

Vertices are added to the **beginning** of the ordering when DFS unwinds from them

![dfst4](http://i.imgur.com/qCYuqrW.png)

After finishing at f, DFS unwinds

DFS may need to be restarted several times before the entire graph is covered

Although several separate traversals were required, each vertex was visited exactly once
