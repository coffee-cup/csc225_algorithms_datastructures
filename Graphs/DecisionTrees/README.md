- A *decision tree* is a conceptual representation of a sequence of decisions, such as those made by an algorithm
- The decision tree on the right corresponds to the Min2 algorithm described on the left (which returns the minimum of two numbers).
- The decision tree corresponding to an algorithm describes all possible execution paths of the algorithm.

- The nodes of a are questions
- The subtrees correspond to different answers
- The leaves are the outcome of a sequence of decisions

## Theorem

A binary tree with height h has at most 2^h leaves.
Consequently, a binary tree with q leaves must have height at least log_2(q)
